# Ultimate Tab (Chrome extension)

The extension was written to replace One Tab by adding features that I need, such as opening a group of tabs without deleting and sorting groups.

I also wanted to give other developers modern, easy-to-read react and typescript code so that everyone could make the necessary changes if they wanted.
