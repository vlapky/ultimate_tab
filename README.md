# Ultimate Tab (Chrome extension)

The extension was written to replace One Tab by adding features that I need, such as opening a group of tabs without deleting and sorting groups.

I also wanted to give other developers modern, easy-to-read react and typescript code so that everyone could make the necessary changes if they wanted.

## Features
- Toolbar
  - Store all tabs (when clicking on the icon in the toolbar)
  - Close all tabs
  - Open Ultimate tab app
- App
  - Open - open group without deleting
  - Pop - open group with deleting
  - Pin - save group from deleting
  - Delete group
  - Drag and drop for tabs and groups

## Stack

- Vite
- React
- TypeScript

## For start dev
- run `yarn buildWatch`
- download the unpacked extension from the `dist` folder
